  <Overview>Wizarr is an automatic user invitation system for Plex, Jellyfin and Emby. Create a unique link and share it to a user and they will be invited to your Media Server after they complete their signup process! They can even be guided to download the clients and read instructions on how to use your media software!&#xD;
&#xD;
Choose between the stable, beta, or nightly branch as per your requirements. Note: Once you upgrade to the beta version, you cannot downgrade to the stable version without formatting. The nightly build is strictly for development or testers and should not be used in production environments.</Overview>
